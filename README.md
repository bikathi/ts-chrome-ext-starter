# Vanilla TypeScript Chrome Extension Starter

This template is a starting point for creating a Chrome extension using TypeScript. It includes a basic structure with a manifest file, a background script, and a content script, and uses Vite as a build tool.

Special thanks to [Guocaoyi](https://github.com/guocaoyi) for providing the bulk of the initial codebase over at: [This Github Link](https://github.com/guocaoyi/create-chrome-ext/tree/main/template-vanilla-ts)

> Unlike Guocaoyi's starter, this template uses TailwindCSS 4 for styling to ensure it's more friendly to developers who use TailwindCSS.
